For ST3 only. Based on [https://github.com/alexgorbatchev/syntaxhighlighter/](https://github.com/alexgorbatchev/syntaxhighlighter/) SyntaxHighlighter. Small plugin for open current file in browser, in MS-Word friednly format. I made this for my classes, which envolves a lot ot code listings in documents. 

Not tested anywhere but chrome and MacOSX. 

CSS files for SyntaxHiglighter slightly changed (basically I had to create new theme and get rid of everything which Word doesn't understand) Since I see no other usage for this tool, nothing is configurable either :)

# Installation

# Usage:
Just one hotkey: Ctrl+K, Ctrl+F or Super+K, Super+F on mac.
